2) Pour mixture into ice cream maker’s freezer bowl. Let it churn for about 20 minutes (or according to your machine’s manufacturer instructions.)
3) Add in the chopped Oreos and keep churning for another 5-10 minutes or until mixture is thick and creamy. If your machine’s instructions vary for add-ins, please follow those instructions instead.
